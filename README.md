# Text-Based Game

This repository contains a simple text-based game built in Python. The game runs in the terminal and consists of two Python files:

- **main.py**: This is the main script that executes the game.
- **text_display.py**: This module contains functions for displaying text in the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by running:

```sh
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Running the Game

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone 
   cd Python-Game
   ```
2. Run the game using Python:
   ```sh https://github.com/LoganDawes/Python-Game
   python main.py
   ```
   or, if your system uses Python 3 as the default version:
   ```sh
   python3 main.py
   ```
